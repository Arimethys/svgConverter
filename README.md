svgConverter
Summary
============
A script to convert SVG files to Raphael JS.
This was designed for SVG files generated by the Inkscape Vector Graphics program.
(inkscape.org)

Purpose
============
This script is designed to parse SVG files for conversion to the Raphael JS format.
Raphael JS 2.0 is a javascript library that generates and animates cross-browser friendly
vector graphics for the web. (raphaeljs.com)
Some SVG images have too many paths for manually copy-pasting into Raphael JS formatting.
This script reads the SVG file as XML and generates a Raphael JS canvas of the same size.
It then grabs all the 'path' elements in the SVG and their attributes, writing a javascript array
containing this data.  It ends by writing a javascript loop to draw each path on the Raphael JS
canvas.

Use
============
To prepare an SVG file in Inkscape for parsing:
-Select all, and then under the 'Path' top menu choose 'Object to Path'
-Eliminate all layers by copy-pasting all paths onto the blank page and deleting layers
-Select all paths and the 'Path' top menu choose 'Break Apart'

These steps will simplify the structure of the SVG file and allow the svgConverter to parse it easily.
